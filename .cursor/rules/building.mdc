# Building

You must determine what environment you are in first, with `uname`.

## Windows CMD (MSYS_NT)

Run: `build.bat`

## Windows Git Bash (MINGW64)

Run: `cmd.exe //c build.bat`

Due to the quirky path mangling of Git Bash, you must run with 2 slashes on the `//c`. Don't ever pipe (|) it.

## Linux

Run: `./build.sh`
