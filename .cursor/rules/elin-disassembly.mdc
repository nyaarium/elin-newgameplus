# Elin Disassembly Documentation

Local disassembly repo: `./disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/`

Begin all searches in: `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/`

If it is missing, download as a ZIP `https://github.com/Elin-Modding-Resources/Elin-Decompiled/archive/refs/heads/main.zip` and extract to put the repo in: `./disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/`.

## File Patterns

C# source under `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/`:

- **Filename:** `{ClassName}.cs` (no prefix/suffix).
  - Type files: `Chara.cs`, `Card.cs`, etc. (classes, structs, enums, interfaces).
  - Immediate directories:
    - `Algorithms/`
    - `Assets/`
    - `Plugins.basecore/`
    - `Plugins.UI/`
    - `Properties/`
    - `TwoDLaserPack/`
- **Nested classes:** In the same .cs class file as the outer class (`GameSetting.cs` contains `GameSetting`, `TransData`, `AudioSetting`, `UISetting`, `RenderSetting`). Grep for `class InnerName` inside the class file.

## Important Tool Usages

**Never read these files in full** - they are too large and will explode context. Do not use the `Read` tool on disassembly .cs files without `offset` and `limit`.

**The disassembly directory is git-ignored.** From workspace root, `LS` and `Glob` will not show it. You must start from `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/` or a subdirectory for any listing or file search.

- **List files**: Use the `LS` tool. Do not list from workspace root expecting to see the disassembly.
  - **target_directory**: `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/` (or a subpath).
- **Targeted greps**: Use the `Grep` tool. **path** must be under the disassembly or a subdirectory; it will not appear from workspace root.
  - **path**: `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/Chara.cs` or `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/` (file or dir).
  - **pattern**: any regex (`public.*\w+\(`).
- **Search by file name**: Use the `Glob` tool. You must set the directory to the disassembly; it will not appear in results if you search from workspace root.
  - **target_directory**: `disassembly/Elin-Decompiled-main/Elin/`.
  - **glob_pattern**: the pattern of what to search for (`*Chara*.cs`).
- **Section reads only**: Use the `Read` tool when you must see a method body.
  - **path**: the file path.
  - **offset**: line number (Grep output is line-numbered; use the match line or a few lines before).
  - **limit**: number of lines to read (20–50).

## Notes

- Generated from `Elin.dll` using dnSpy.
- Some names may be compiler-generated or obfuscated.
- Properties showing `[get]` only may still have mutable underlying values.
