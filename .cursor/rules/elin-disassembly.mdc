# Elin Disassembly Documentation

Local Path: `./Elin-Decompiled-main/`

If it is missing, download as a ZIP `https://github.com/Elin-Modding-Resources/Elin-Decompiled/archive/refs/heads/main.zip` and extract to put the repo in: `./Elin-Decompiled-main/`.

## File Patterns

**Class documentation:** `class{ClassName}.html`
- Example: `classCard.html`, `classChara.html`
- Shows: public methods, properties, inheritance

**Source code:** `{ClassName}_8cs_source.html`
- Example: `Card_8cs_source.html`, `Game_8cs_source.html`
- Use line numbers in grep results to find specific sections

**Nested classes:** `class{OuterClass}_1_1{InnerClass}.html`
- Example: `classGameSetting_1_1StartSetting.html`
- `_1_1` indicates nested class

## Important: Use Grep, Not Direct Reads

**Never attempt to read these HTML files directly** - they are too large and will explode context. Do not use `read_file` on HTML files from this directory.

1. **Use targeted greps**: Use the `grep` tool to search for specific patterns in the local files
   - Example: Use `grep` tool with pattern `"public.*MethodName"`, path `Elin-Decompiled-main/classCard.html`, and case-insensitive flag
2. **Search by file type**: Use `glob_file_search` to find files by pattern
   - Example: `glob_file_search` with pattern `"*Chara*.html"` in `Elin-Decompiled-main/`
3. **Avoid reading entire files**: Only read specific sections if grep doesn't find what you need and you must see the exact context

## Usage

1. **Search locally**: All files are in `./Elin-Decompiled-main/` - no downloading needed
2. **Use the `grep` tool** to search for specific patterns (method names, properties, etc.) in the local HTML files
3. **Use `glob_file_search`** to find files by name pattern

## Notes

- Generated from `Elin.dll` using dnSpy and Doxygen
- Some names may be compiler-generated or obfuscated
- Properties showing `[get]` only may still have mutable underlying values
