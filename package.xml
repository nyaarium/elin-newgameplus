    [h2]New Game++[/h2]

    This mod lets you export your character and import it into a new game, as a new game+ character.

    Now requires: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3381182341]Mod Options[/url]

    [i][url=https://github.com/nyaarium/elin-newgameplus]GitHub Repo[/url][/i]

    [h2]Game updated? Found a bug?[/h2]

    [url=https://github.com/nyaarium/elin-newgameplus/issues?q=is%3Aissue]File an issue on the Issues tab[/url] with [b]what the problem is[/b]. (I work with GitHub repos every day, so I will notice if you file properly)

    If you just comment on Steam, I may not notice (I'm not even logged in most of the time).

    Credits again to the original author for creating the original mod. This mod has changed quite significantly, so I don't think anyone minds me publishing a fork.

    [h2]How to Use[/h2]

    [olist]
    [*]Middle-click your heart stone in your old save to export it.
    [*]Visit the Mod Options if you want to customize what's imported.
    [*]Start a new game. Your appearance will be restored. Change as desired. You can also change your race/class.
    [*]Continue until you see the game world. Your stats will restore, and items spawn.

    [b]2026.01.28[/b]

    [*]Added config options to control whether healing and disease curing occur during import.
    [*]Thanks to AI Agent [i](Cursor Code)[/i] for refactor help, rough translations, and reverse-engineering decompiled code/docs totaling [b]240000+ lines[/b]
